excerpt: Quick overview of Travis CI possibilities
---

I decided to check **Travis CI** for my **github** projects. I've heard
many good opinions about it, so decided to do read a bit.
This post is about what I found out.

## Short reminder what is CI

**CI** (**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration) is a development practice of
checking *quality* and *integration* of software **continuously**. For
development team it's usually a tool which is *integrated* with their *code repository*, which
builds their application every commit. This tool can also **run tests**, check
**code style**, etc. I think the most popular tool for this is **Jenkins** - it can be used
for every code base. There are also some tools for each *repository* platform, for
example: **Travis CI** for **GitHub** or **GitLab CI** (their *pipelines* looks really
promising...).

# Travis CI

To start you need to have an account on **GitHub** and
on [**Travis CI**](https://travis-ci.org/) platform.
Also it's nice to have a repository for which you want to use *continuous
integration*.

On **Travis CI** web page find your profile - if you want to *enable* **Travis CI** for
your repository
just change a switch. This is how it looks for me:

After enabling **Travis CI** support for your repository, you need to
add `.travis.yml` file to it and trigger a build by **pushing**
some *commits*.

## Travis CI environment

For every *build* there is a fresh instance of **virtual machine** used,
so you start from scratch every time. By default it uses
**Ubuntu 12.04** or **14.04 LTS** **64-bit edition**. It is also possible
to run build under
**OS X** somehow. **Windows** is not supported :wink:.

There are many *pre-installed*
tools you can use - for example `wget` or `curl`. Multiple data stores can be used,
for instance *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL*, *Redis*, *Cassandra*, *MongoDB*, etc.
I was surprised that even there is a support for browser (currently only **Firefox**)
and messaging queues (*RabbitMQ* or *ZeroMQ*). There are plenty configuration
options, tools and things you can define for your build.

## Magic .travis.yml file

This magic `.travis.yml` file is for defining **how to build** your project.
It has to
be in `yaml` format - it's similar to `json`, but with indents instead of brackets.
This makes it more human readable.

Not all technologies are supported by **Travis CI**.
Here is a list of [supported languages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started).
It's allowed to *add support* for new languages - you just need to
gather a small team (3 people)
and create PR to **Travis CI** project following their guidelines.

`.travis.yml` should have three parts:
* language declaration
* install definition
* script definition

There can also be a part `deploy`, but it's optional and I did't
use it. I've read it can even deploy something on **github pages** or
**amazon services**, so it's worth checking.
You can set up **environment** variables using `env` tag.

### Language definition

For **Travis CI** it's important that you declare in what **language** is your
project - it defines which version of **virtual machine image** builder will use.
It will set up default **runtime** for this language.
It's possible to use **multiple** programming languages in your build, but you need
to add others as *dependencies*. Anyway, on every **virtual machine** there
is support for *Python*, *Ruby*, *Node.js* and *GO*. Also *OpenJDK* is supported
be default.

#### Build matrix

When you declare **runtime**, you can use multiple versions, for example:

    language: erlang
    otp_release:
      - 18.2.1
      - 18.1
      - 18.0
      - 17.5

Project with settings above will be build for all of there versions
of **otp** (this part is custom
for all languages, so for instance for **Ruby** you can declare **rvm** version, etc). When
you add also some **environment** variables:

    env:
        - DB=postgres
        - DB=mysql

it will perform builds against **all possible configurations**, so
*8* builds - for each version of **otp** and for each environment variables declaration.

If your **build matrix** becomes too big, it's possible to exclude some configurations.

### Install part of Travis CI configuration

**Install** part is for defining what **dependencies** are to be **installed**
before running build. For example it can look like this:

    install: ./install-dependencies.sh

There is also `before_install` step in which
you can define for example what other **Ubuntu Packages** you want to install before
dependencies. If you want to **skip** install part just
do:

    install: true

Note that every command in this part **has to succeed** to
continue your build, otherwise
your build will finish with **error** status.

### Script part of Travis CI configuration

Script part of project is for **running building script**, **tests** or
other checks.
How script part looks *depends* on a project **language**. For example for **Erlang**
it will use `rebar` by default, for **Python** `pip` and for **GO** `make go-deps` which
should be defined in your `Makefile`. You can also define which steps
should be done in `after_script` or `before_script`.

When one of `script` commands **fails**, **Travis CI** will **continue** and **accumulate**
the result. So if for running all tests, you need multiple commands, don't worry,
you'll **see all fails** :wink:.

### Conclusion

**Travis CI** seems to be a *powerful* tool. There is support for the most known
technologies, but I'm not sure what happens when you use something **obscure**.
On the other side there are plenty technologies on supported tools list...
Also it's possible to extend **Travis CI** with new ones, but you have to do it
by yourself (or find someone who will do it).

Configuration seems to be fairly *simple* and gives *plenty options*, but it's also
easy to start, unless you have some *legacy* project. Also I think **documentation**
is very good - it's easy to understand what's going on and why. Maybe default
options should be stressed more clearly. For me **Travis CI** is
definitely worth checking more.
