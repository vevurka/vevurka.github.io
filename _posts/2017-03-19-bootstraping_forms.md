## Quick reminder what is **frisor**

**Frisor** is a web application in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls. When using untrusted network
I don't want to login anywhere to save interesting content I found. More about this is here:
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %}).

This week I did mostly refactoring - I introduced **Django Forms** instead of rendering form by hand
(it means I rewrote all logic for views).
I added some **Django** library for managing **bootstrap** styles
(actually picking one was really painful) - error management improved because of that.
All my *html* templates are rewritten.

My github repo: [firsor repo](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor).

Currently successfully added url in my application looks like this:

## Forms in **Django**

Usage of *forms* on web pages is so popular, that in **Django** there is a special mechanism for them.
It allows to add a *form* as a part of *context* to template - then render it automatically, so
a programmer doesn't have to write a *html* code. To start with *forms* it's necessary to create `forms.py` file and create
a *class* which derives from `django.forms.Form`. For a simple *form* without custom validation
it's enough to create a *form* fields in this *class*, which correspond to fields desired in *html* *form*.
Here is an example of my *form* for urls:

{% highlight python %}
    # forms.py
    from django import forms


    class UrlForm(forms.Form):
        url = forms.URLField(label='URL')
        title = forms.CharField(label='Title')
        nick = forms.CharField(label='Nick')
{% endhighlight %}

Next in `views.py` if you use method views you need to create an instance of this *form* and add it to *view context*.
*Class* views for *forms* I covered in later part of this post.

{% highlight python %}

    # views.py
    # def index():
    # ...
        form = UrlForm()
        context = {
            'url_list': url_list,
            'form': form
        }
        return render(request, 'index.html', context)
{% endhighlight %}

After that we can use this form in *html* templates in this way:

{% highlight jinja %}
{% raw %}
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

But there is one issue with that - this *form* again looks very bad... All my **bootstrap** styles
at my form are gone!

### Bootstraping **Django Forms**

There are a few solutions on how to style a *form* which was created using **Django Forms** mechanism.

#### Libraries

There are plenty libraries which can help with adding **bootstrap** to templates or *forms*:

* **django-bootstrap3**
* **django-bootstrap-form**
* **django-forms-bootstrap**
* **django-crispy-forms**

Actually it seems that names of these libraries were generated by some **Django** names generator.
It's hard to see a difference between **django-bootstrap-form** and **django-forms-bootstrap**...
Unfortunately, I didn't find **forms-django-bootstrap** - maybe I should write it myself.

These libraries are quite similar - they all add new custom **bootstrap** filters to templates.
All of them have to be loaded into template, for example:
{% raw %} `{% load bootstrap3 %}` {% endraw %}, to use form rendered with **bootstrap** styles:
{% raw %} `{% bootstrap_form form %}` {% endraw %} or
{% raw %} `{{form | bootstrap }}` {% endraw %}.
And for all of them it looks the same - it's still the same **bootstrap**!

Anyway in my **frisor** project I decided to use **django-bootstrap3**, because this one is not
about forms only. Still the documentation of this framework sucks - for example they forgot to mention
that to use it, it should be put into `settings.py` in `INSTALLED_APPS` as `bootstrap3`.

It's really painful that there is no naming convention for **Django** packages and application names.
Actually application name can be so different than package name - you are on your own there...

#### Styling in **Django Forms** *class*

It's possible to put styles into *forms class*. For me it's quite bad design, because
a *form* should be just a model of data and it shouldn't have anything to do with presentation of it.
It's the same as putting some business logic into *ORM* model *class*.

Anyway here is an example:
{% highlight python %}
    {% raw %}
    # models.py
    from django import forms


    class UrlForm(forms.Form):
        url = forms.URLField(label='URL')
        title = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'class': 'form-control'}),
                                label='Title')
    {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

There is a possibility to add *html* attributes to widget field of model field constructor.
Also there are other ways to achieve this: by using **Meta class** in *form class*. **Meta
classes** deserve more attention, so I'll leave them for feature posts.

#### Styling in *html* templates

There are two ways: writing own filter which will add a *css* class to a field or
simply putting all necessary styles into *html* form by hand (it means you don't have to add a form
to context when rendering view). I'll not cover them more - first is about custom filters in
templates for what I want to write a separate post. Second way I've used previous week.


## Class view and *forms* in **Django**

Actually I was a bit surprised that **Django** tutorial didn't mention that it's possible
to have a *class* views in `views.py`. Actually I've read that `views.py` with methods instead
of *classes* is quite bad design. So I refactored my `views.py` to use *class* views - for a *form* for
`Urls` I've a *class* `UrlForm` which derives from `django.views.generic.FormView`. I've implemented
two methods from it - `get_context_data` is for managing context for all requests,
`form_valid(form)` for managing request from *form*. My new `views.py` looks like this:

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py
    import logging

    from django.contrib import messages
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.views.generic import FormView

    from .models import Url
    from .forms import UrlForm

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


    class UrlView(FormView):

        form_class = UrlForm
        template_name = 'index.html'
        success_url = '/'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super().get_context_data()
            url_list = Url.objects.order_by('-publish_date').all()
            context['url_list'] = url_list
            return context

        def form_valid(self, form):
            context = self.get_context_data()
            context['form'] = form

            title = self.request.POST.get('title')
            nick = self.request.POST.get('nick')
            url = self.request.POST.get('url')

            db_url = Url.create(url=url, title=title, nick=nick)
            db_url.save()

            messages.success(self.request, 'Your new url: %s' % url,
                             extra_tags='safe')
            return render(self.request, 'index.html', context)
{% endhighlight %}

Method `form_valid` does the saving url logic as before I did in my `index` method. Method
`get_context_data` is responsible for getting all urls from database and put them into context to
render on my `index.html` template.
To render an `index.html` template properly you need to point to a *class view* using `as_view` method:
{% highlight python %}
{% raw %}
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', UrlView.as_view())
        ]
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In my `views.py` there are *messages* - they allow to display error or success messages in a
nice way:

{% highlight jinja %}
{% raw %}
    <!-- index.html -->
    {% for message in messages %}
        <div class="{{ message|bootstrap_message_classes }} alert-dismissable">
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-hidden="true">&#215;</button>
            {{ message|safe }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

and they are shown like this:

## My TODO list:

0. Introduce unit tests.
1. Add comments and tags to urls.
2. Refactor database logic from `views.py` to use some `service.py`.
3. Fix issue with not cleared form after submit.
4. Read about **WebSockets** to introduce chat mechanism.
