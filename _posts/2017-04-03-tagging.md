## Quick reminder what is **frisor**

**Frisor** is a web application in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls. When using untrusted network
I don't want to login anywhere to save interesting content I found. More about this is here:
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %}).

This week I introduced *tags* for my urls. As I didn't want to reinvent a wheel again,
I decided to use some **Django** library for *tagging*. More about my experiences in next part of
this post.

**Frisor** on github: [firsor repo](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor).

Currently *autocompletion* of adding *tag* in my application looks like this:

## Libraries for tagging in **Django**

What do I want from tagging library:
* easy *autocomplete*
* *select2* widget as input for tags
* not too complicated schema in database
* maintained code repository

There are a few libraries for *tagging* in **Django**:
* **django-tagging**
* **django-taggit**
* **django-tagulous**

All of them just suck, maybe the last one not so much as the rest of them.

### Why **django-tagging** sucks?

It has a bit complicated *database schema* - for me it was too generic. They say that's enough to add
`tagging.registry.register` function in `model.py` to register a *model* for *tagging*:

{% highlight python %}
    # models.py
    from django.db import models

    from tagging.registry import register

    class Url(models.Model):
        url = models.URLField()
        publish_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        nick = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    register(Url)  # register an Url model for tagging

{% endhighlight %}

After creating and running *migrations* (because it's a change in *model* it's quite obvious we have to do that)
it created many tables in database: `tagging_taggeditem` and `tagging_tag`. The first table
is quite generic and consist four rows, the second one has only tags:

{% highlight bash %}
    sqlite> select * from tagging_taggeditem;
    id          object_id   content_type_id  tag_id
    ----------  ----------  ---------------  ----------
    1           3           1                1
    2           3           1                2
    3           5           1                3
    4           5           1                4
    5           6           1                5
    6           6           1                6
    sqlite> select * from tagging_tag;
    id          name
    ----------  ----------
    1           house
    2           thing
    3           like
    4           tags
    5           github
    6           python
{% endhighlight %}

The design here looks like this: we have one table - `tagging_taggeditem` for all *tagged* objects -
there are three *foreign keys*: `object_id` (for an actual id of item we want to *tag*), `content_type_id`
(to check from which table we should get this item) and `tag_id` (id of tag in corresponding tag table).

Quite complicated, isn't it?
I definitely don't need that, especially without builtin *autocomplete*.

I tried to add *autocompletion* with another library, but I found out that **django-taggit** is more recommended
for this feature.

The other thing is that the last commit in the repository of **django-tagging** was about 6 months ago.
I'm using the newest version of **Django**, so for me it's important to use maintained libraries - that was
the last reason to decide against it.


### Why **django-taggit** sucks?

Setting **django-taggit** up was quite easy - registering  mechanism in *models* is a bit different, but overall installation
process was the same (add to *apps*, register tags in *model*, add field to *form*). It doesn't have builtin
*autocomplete*, so I decided to try **django-taggit-autocomplete**, but
it didn't go well with **Django 1.10**. So it was time to find another *autocomplete* library - the most promising was
**django-autocomplete-light**.

#### Don't use **django-autocomplete-light**, just don't

It has an outdated documentation, the nightmare starts from *imports* to not existing components, for example
I wanted to use some nice looking widget for tags in my *forms*, but it happens that they've removed it!
Examples in documentation doesn't work with current version of their library. But the thing which
was the worst - they've clearly written:

> Python 2.7, 3.4, Django 1.8+ support

No, as expected - they don't support **Django 1.10**: the `urls.py` file they provide is not valid for this
version. So, no. No **django-autocomplete-light** for me.

### Last try - **django-tagulous**

I was quite desperate, I've almost decided to write my own *tagging*. Actually, the design is quite simple - create
a **many-to-many relation** in database, provide **select2 widget** to form, do *autocompletion* (so create an
**endpoint** which searches for *tags* in *database* and returns a **list** for current *autocomplete* query),
but implementation is time consuming.

I decided to try with the last library - **django-tagulous**, at *documentation* page it's written that it's
much simpler than other libraries for *tagging* and it has *autocompletion*. Actually it all happen to be true
and after setting it up, it works like a charm. But setting it up wasn't so easy - I'm not sure about a reason,
but in *documentation* there is no word about how to provide **javascript's** and **styles** in *templates* for
*tagging*.
I had to do this by hand by just putting necessary scripts in `head` of my *html* and
use `$ python manage.py collectstatic` mechanism.
In *documentation* and example application they mention special *template* tag for this, but it didn't work
for me.

### Some thoughts

I think I could use all that time I spent for looking and trying **tagging libraries**, for implementation
of **my own** *tagging*. Probably it would be more educative and interesting. Of course I would *reinvent a wheel
again*, but maybe in this case it would be **less costly**. Usually I'm against approach for writing own
versions of something which exists, but maybe that should depend on a case. So, today I've learned that
sometimes it's just faster to do something from the beginning than rely on others work.
