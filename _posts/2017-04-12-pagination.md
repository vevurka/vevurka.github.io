## Quick reminder what is **frisor**

**Frisor** is a web application in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls. When using untrusted network
I don't want to login anywhere to save interesting content I found. More about this is here:
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %}).

This week I introduced **pagination** in my urls table.

**Frisor** on github: [firsor repo](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor).

Currently pagination in my urls table in my application looks like this:

## Pagination in **Django**

I was a bit surprised how easy was setting up a **pagination** in **Django**. For me it was
enough to follow documentation - it worked with my first try!

The concept of **pagination** is quite easy - there is needed a *structure* which contains
all data and can divide it into *sublists* with given length called **pages**.

### Initializing pagination

In **Django** framework there is a `django.core.paginator.Paginator` which is responsible for managing pages - to
initialize it, you have to give it a **number of elements** which should be on a page
and a **collection of data**. It can be `QuerySet`, `list` or anything which has length (so implements `__len__()` method). For example:

{% highlight python %}
    p = Paginator(['string1', 'string2', 'string3'], 2)
{% endhighlight %}
On the **first page** we will have `['string1', 'string2']` and on the **second (and last) page** we will have
`['string3']`.

The important thing here is that given data should have **constant order**, so it's not a good idea to use for example a
`set`, because it's not ordered.

There are two optional arguments which can be given to `Paginator`:

* `orphans` - it doesn't allow to have **less than** or **equal**
    given number elements on a *last page*, they are added to *previous page*
* `allow_empty_first_page` - it throws `EmptyPage` exception when there are no elements

In case of `orphans` parameter set:
{% highlight python %}
    p = Paginator(['string1', 'string2', 'string3'], 2, orphans=1)
{% endhighlight %}
we will have all three elements on the *first page*, because we don't allow *last page* to contain **less than**
or **equal** **1** element. So, basically we use it when we don't want to have **too less** data on *last page*.

I wasn't sure what happens if we set `orphans` to be bigger than length of our query set:
{% highlight python %}
    p = Paginator(['string1', 'string2', 'string3'], 2, orphans=4)
{% endhighlight %}
but it happens that all elements are put to the *first page* in that case. It works that way even when
we set:
{% highlight python %}
    p = Paginator(['string1', 'string2', 'string3'], 2,
                  orphans=4,
                  allow_empty_first_page=False)
{% endhighlight %}
Authors of this library were quite thoughtful :wink:!


Ok, so we have an object which contains our paged data, what we can do with it?

### Using pagination in a view

`Paginator` has only one method: `page(number)`, which for a given number returns a **list of elements** (packaged
in a `Page` object) which should be on a page with that number or raises `InvalidPage` exception if it doesn't exist.
So for:
{% highlight python %}
    paginator = Paginator(['string1', 'string2', 'string3'], 2)
    page = paginator.page(1)
    print(page.object_list)
{% endhighlight %}
it will print `['string1', 'string2']`.

So, now let's use it in a **view**. Somehow we have to store information in a **view** about page we are currently at -
I think using parameter `page` in **GET** request is the best option here.

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py
    class UrlView(FormView):
    # ...

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super().get_context_data()

            # ordered collection:
            url_list = Url.objects.order_by('-publish_date').all()
            paginator = Paginator(url_list, self.number_of_items)
            page = self.request.GET.get('page') # stored page number

            # get list of urls which should be on page:
            try:
                url_list = paginator.page(page)
            except PageNotAnInteger: # invalid page number, f.e not a number
                url_list = paginator.page(1)
            except EmptyPage: # not existing page number
                url_list = paginator.page(paginator.num_pages)
            context['url_list'] = url_list
            return context
{% endhighlight %}
So now, instead of putting whole `url_list` in response context I put *trimmed* collection. I could see one issue with code
above: *all urls* from database are taken *every request*, but that's **not true**. According to
documentation `Url.objects.all()` (`Url` is a `model`)
returns a `QuerySet` which is **lazy evaluated**, so it takes only the data which is needed. The second thing here is
that `QuerySet` **caches its results**, so it doesn't have to evaluate query every time.

### Pagination in templates

To manage pagination in templates, we have to use `django.core.paginator.Page` (do you remember? It packages list of
objects we want to paginate - it's returned by `django.core.paginator.Paginator.page` method)
attributes like:

* `has_previous` to check if we can access to page with `previous_page_number`
* `has_next` to check if we can access to page with `next_page_number`
* `number` to get current page number
* `paginator.num_pages` to get **paginator** object associated with **page**, which contains information about
number of all pages

So our template can look like this:
{% highlight jinja %}
{% raw %}
    <!-- index.html -->
    <div class="pagination">
        <span class="step-links">
            {% if url_list.has_previous %}
                <a href="?page={{ url_list.previous_page_number }}">previous</a>
            {% endif %}

            <span class="current">
                Page {{ url_list.number }} of {{ url_list.paginator.num_pages }}.
            </span>

            {% if url_list.has_next %}
                <a href="?page={{ url_list.next_page_number }}">next</a>
            {% endif %}
        </span>
    </div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
It will show not styled *clickable paginator* in which we can navigate to get to *next* and *previous* page.
It uses `page` parameter in `href` attribute of navigation link.

If we use `django-bootstrap` it's more simple, just use `bootstrap_pagination` tag:

{% highlight jinja %}
    {% raw %} {% bootstrap_pagination url_list %} {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Some thoughts

Pagination isn't so hard to design it, but they did a good job in **Django**, so it was not necessary to implement it
by my own. I'm quite happy that in `django-bootstrap` there is builtin tag for it, so I had to do almost nothing.
Next week I'm going to introduce some filtering to my urls table.

Any comments?
