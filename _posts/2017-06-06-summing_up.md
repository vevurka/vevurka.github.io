excerpt: Some thoughts on my participation in DSP17 contest

This post will **not be technical**, so you can skip it, if you don't care.
I participated in [Get Noticed!](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) blog contest, which
blogging part has ended. The rules were:

* work on a project using **github** to maintain repository
* write **twenty posts** about project or other technical stuff

I worked on my [**firsor**](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor) application.
It is a **web application** in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls
for my personal use.

The scope I described in
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %})
is mostly done - the chat part isn't finished, but it wasn't a **must** requirement.

Currently **my project** looks like this (yep, **bootstrap**!):

![screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017-05-31_screen.png).

It wasn't an ambitious project on purpose - I wanted to focus mostly on blogging part.
On the other side I needed this kind of **application**. It's gonna be
deployed, but I'll not tell you where, because it's for my own use.
**Security by obscurity!**

Anyway it was quite hard to write about two technical posts per week. In the future
I want to do it once per week. I like to have my own blog and I want to become
part of IT-society.

Anyway I want to share some other participant blogs:

* [**drozdziak1.github.io**](https://drozdziak1.github.io/) - about kernel, linux and other very
serious stuff. He has very long blog posts with very high quality. Must read!
* [**aqatl.github.io**](https://aqatl.github.io) - about creating application in GO along with learning
this language. Nice to read!
* [**dsp.krzaq.cc**](https://dsp.krzaq.cc/) - in Polish, I liked that content is different than I usually
read
* [**rock-it.pl**](https://rock-it.pl) - really good stuff about Django
