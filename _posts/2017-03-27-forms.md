excerpt: Why should I use ModelForms for models in Django?
---

This week I had some fun with with forms in **Django** in my application **frisor**.
Here is a post about my progress and issues I've encountered.

## Quick reminder what is **frisor**

**Frisor** is a web application in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls. When using untrusted network
I don't want to login anywhere to save interesting content I found. More about this is here:
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %}).

This week I started to introduce *tags* for my *urls*. As I didn't want to reinvent a wheel
again, I decided to use some **Django** library for tagging, but it's a topic for a different story.
Also I did small fixes:

* after *url* submit form is cleared
* refactored saving data sent by *url form*
* changed in my template: *url list* is now below *url form*
* introduced *tests*

My project on **github**: [**firsor repo**](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor).

Currently my application looks like this:

## Form for model in **Django**

I wanted to have an auto-generated form for my *model* `Url`.
The previous week my `UrlFrom` was derived from `Form` and I had to create and save `Url` object
manually. My *form* was really simple:

{% highlight python %}
    # forms.py - old approach
    from django import forms


    class UrlForm(forms.Form):
        url = forms.URLField(label='URL')
        title = forms.CharField(label='Title')
        nick = forms.CharField(label='Nick')

{% endhighlight %}

After **POST** request I had to extract all request data, create `Url` object instance with this data,
and finally save `Url` object in database like this in my *view*:

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py - old approach
    from django.views.generic import FormView

    from .models import Url

    class UrlView(FormView):
        # ...

        def form_valid(self, form):
            # ...
            title = self.request.POST.get('title')
            nick = self.request.POST.get('nick')
            url = self.request.POST.get('url')

            db_url = Url.create(url=url, title=title, nick=nick) # manually created
            db_url.save()
            # ...

{% endhighlight %}

But it happens that my *form* is based on a single *model* (`Url`) and there is a
mechanism to tell **Django** to save *model* object automatically. Actually it's possible
to have a *form* which is able to handle more complicated models with *foreign* keys -
in documentation there are described mappings between *model* and *form* fields.

Here is my *form* which
derives from `django.forms.ModelForm` instead of `django.forms.Form`:

{% highlight python %}
    # forms.py
    from django import forms

    from .models import Url


    class UrlForm(forms.ModelForm):
        url = forms.URLField(label='URL')
        title = forms.CharField(label='Title')
        nick = forms.CharField(label='Nick')

        class Meta:
            model = Url
            fields = ['url', 'title', 'nick']
{% endhighlight %}

I added a `Meta` *class* in which I defined that my `UrlForm` is based on *model* `Url` and
I listed fields which are used by this *model*.
After that it's enough to use `ModelForm` saving mechanism in *view* like this:

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py
    from django.contrib import messages
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.views.generic import FormView


    class UrlView(FormView):
        # ..

        def form_valid(self, form):
            # ...
            form.save()
            messages.success(self.request,
                             'Your new url: %s' % form.data.get('url'),
                             extra_tags='safe')
            # ...
{% endhighlight %}

Usage of `form.save()` does all the saving logic automatically. Data in *form* is stored as **dictionary**
in `form.data`, so now it's easy to access and I don't have to extract it from `self.request` anymore
to show message about successfully added url.

So adding *url* logic is much simplier, but what actually happen here?

### More details about `ModelForm`

`ModelForm` is a `Form` which has a mechanism for automatic generation of certain fields in
*model*. It generates template data (so **HTML** code for inputs for example)
based on information from its `Meta` *class*. For minimal configuration you need to add
to `Meta` *class*:

* `model` - it declares for which model you want to have fields generated
* `fields` **list** - if you want to have all fields simply: `fields = '__all__'`, but it's recommended
to write them explicitly.

Minimal `ModelForm` can look like this:

{% highlight python %}
    # forms.py
    from django import forms

    from .models import MyModel


    class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = MyModel
            fields = '__all__'
{% endhighlight %}

Main difference between `ModelForm` and `Form` is that it performs two validations:

* *form* validation
* *model* instance validation

instead of only *form* validation.

Another difference is that in `ModelForm` there is `save` method introduced for saving
an instance of an object in database. It performs validations mentioned above if there were
not performed earlier.


#### Customized Meta *class* in ModelForm

`Meta` *class* of `ModelForm` can contain:

* **custom error messages**: `error_messages` which is **dictionary** where *keys* are names of fields
* **excluded fields** of model: `excluded` which should contain **list** of names of excluded fields
* **custom widgets** defined by `widgets` which is **dictionary** where *keys* are names of fields
and *values* are widgets which should be used for those fields
* **custom labels** for fields in **dictionary** `labels` where *keys* are names of fields
and *values* are labels
* **custom help texts** for fields in **dictionary** `help_texts` where *keys* are names of fields
and *values* are help texts
* **custom data types** for fields in **dictionary** `field_classes` where *keys* are names of fields
and *values* are **types** (class names)


### Clearing *form* after submit

Last week I had an issue that my form wasn't cleared after submission. My mistake was that in
my view in method `form_valid` which is run after **POST** request I used
a method `django.shortcuts.render` for rendering *view* after *form* submit.

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py - old approach
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.views.generic import FormView


    class UrlView(FormView):
        # ...
        def form_valid(self, form):
            context = self.get_context_data()
            context['form'] = form
            # ... saving logic
            return render(self.request, 'index.html', context)
{% endhighlight %}

Better approach here is to use `django.shortcuts.redirect`, because after saving a data from
*form*, my *view* should be refreshed to load *urls* data using `self.get_context_data`. It resolved
an issue with not cleared *form* after submit:

{% highlight python %}
    # views.py
    from django.shortcuts import redirect
    from django.views import View
    from django.views.generic import FormView


    class UrlView(FormView):
            # ...
        def form_valid(self, form):
            context = self.get_context_data()
            context['form'] = form
            form.save()
            return redirect('/', context)  # redirect instead of render
{% endhighlight %}
