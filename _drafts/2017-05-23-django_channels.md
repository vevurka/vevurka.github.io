## Quick reminder

## Channels in Django:


From doc:
"""If youâ€™ve used channels in Go: Go channels are reasonably similar to Django ones.
 The key difference is that Django channels are network-transparent; the implementations
  of channels we provide are all accessible across a
network to consumers and producers running in different processes or on different machines."""
