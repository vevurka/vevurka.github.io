Here is very basic description on what is a **tree**. I tried to describe
things as *simple as possible*, sometimes skipping some details.
This post is meant to be for
people who just started programming.

My previous posts were about
an [array]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-08-data_structures_array.md %})
and 
a [list]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-16-data_structures_list.md %})
- make sure you know what these data structures are, because I'm going
to use them in this post.

# Tree

**Tree** is a *collection*, so we use it to store more than
one element.

This time this data structure name almost matches its intuitive definition:

![screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017-06-26_tree.png){: .align-cente r}.

Why picture is upside down? That's because we always start from
root of a tree and we usually read from top to bottom direction. 
In some smart computer-science books trees looks always like this.

So in a tree we have a root and a nodes.

Tree is a data structure with nodes in which:
one node is distinguished as a root node
every node is connected with directed edge to exactly one other node


## What you can do with a tree?



### Create a tree

### Append to tree

### Search tree

### Summing up
